# Frontend Engineering Standards

## Goal

Write code that is strong against change, not merely code that works today.

## Senior Standard

Junior code makes the feature work.
Mid-level code makes the feature reusable.
Senior code makes future changes cheap.

## Core Rules

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle

One function, component, or hook should own one reason to change.

Bad:

```ts
const save = async () => {
  validate();
  openConfirmModal();
  await api.save();
  showToast();
  navigate();
};
```

Good:

```ts
validateBeforeSave();
confirmSave();
doSave();
navigateAfterSave();
```

Review questions:

- Does this function do more than one job?
- Does the name contain "and" or imply a chain of unrelated work?
- Are validation, API calls, navigation, and UI feedback mixed together?

### 2. Separation of Concerns

Do not hide business rules inside JSX.

Bad:

```tsx
<Button disabled={plan.status === "approved" && revision.reason === "meal"} />
```

Good:

```tsx
const canRequestPlanAdjustment = checkPlanAdjustmentAvailable(plan, revision);
<Button disabled={!canRequestPlanAdjustment} />;
```

Review questions:

- Is JSX carrying business policy?
- Would a policy change require editing a visual component?

### 3. DRY

Repeated policy means missing domain modeling.

Bad:

```ts
goal.targetWeight < profile.currentWeight;
```

Good:

```ts
isWeightLossGoal(goal, profile);
```

Review questions:

- Is the same condition repeated?
- Would a change require multiple edits?

### 4. Abstraction

Call sites should explain intent, not implementation.

Bad:

```ts
if (reason === "meal" && remainingMeals.length > 0)
```

Good:

```ts
if (shouldAdjustRemainingMeals(adjustmentRequest, todayPlan))
```

Review questions:

- Can a product person understand the condition name?
- Are implementation details leaking into screens?

### 5. Encapsulation

Business rules belong in domain functions.

Bad:

```ts
if (planItem.status !== "completed")
```

Good:

```ts
isPlanItemAdjustable(planItem);
```

Review questions:

- Is a policy scattered across files?
- Is there one place to change it?

### 6. Domain Modeling

Use product language in code.

Preferred terms:

- `Plan`
- `PlanItem`
- `PlanRevision`
- `AdjustmentRequest`
- `AdjustmentReason`
- `DailyCheckIn`
- `TodayPlan`

Avoid vague names:

- `data`
- `item`
- `thing`
- `statusData`
- `handleAction`
- `doStuff`

### 7. Derived State

Do not store values that can be calculated from existing state.

Bad:

```ts
const [isAdjustmentAvailable, setIsAdjustmentAvailable] = useState(false);
```

Good:

```ts
const isAdjustmentAvailable = canAdjustTodayPlan(todayPlan);
```

State is allowed for:

- User input.
- Draft data.
- Server snapshots.
- Expensive computed values with memoization.

### 8. Declarative Programming

Prefer declaring outcomes over pushing state around.

Bad:

```ts
if (completedCount === totalCount) {
  setDone(true);
} else {
  setDone(false);
}
```

Good:

```ts
const isTodayPlanDone = completedCount === totalCount;
```

### 9. Predictable Data Flow

Use one-directional flow:

User action -> validation -> domain logic -> API/AI -> state update -> UI render

Review questions:

- Where can this state change?
- Can more than one component mutate the same concept?
- Is a hook hiding navigation, API, and UI side effects together?

### 10. Maintainability

Every implementation should answer:

If product changes this rule tomorrow, where do we edit?

The target is one obvious edit location.

### 11. Composition

Build large behavior by composing small pieces.

Bad:

```tsx
<TodayScreen />
```

where one file owns loading, plan display, food logging, adjustment, revision approval, analytics, and navigation.

Good:

```tsx
<TodayScreen>
  <TodayPlanSection />
  <AdjustmentEntryPoint />
  <ProgressSummary />
</TodayScreen>
```

Hook composition:

```ts
const todayPlan = useTodayPlan();
const adjustment = usePlanAdjustment();
const analytics = useAnalytics();
```

### 12. TSDoc and Flow Comments

Code should explain the product flow well enough that a future developer can understand why the function exists before reading every line.

Use TSDoc for exported functions, exported types, hooks, domain helpers, AI contract helpers, persistence helpers, analytics helpers, and non-trivial UI components.

Required:

- Every exported function, hook, class, type, and component should have a TSDoc block.
- Every domain or policy function should explain the product rule it protects.
- Every hook should explain what state it owns, what side effects it performs, and what it intentionally does not own.
- Every AI or API boundary should document input assumptions, output guarantees, and fallback behavior.
- Every persistence helper should document storage key ownership and serialization expectations.
- Every component that coordinates a flow should document the user journey it represents.

Avoid:

- Comments that repeat implementation.
- Comments that explain obvious syntax.
- Stale comments that describe an old flow.
- Long essays inside functions.

Bad:

```ts
// Sets the status.
export function updateStatus(status: PlanItemStatus) {
  return status;
}
```

Good:

```ts
/**
 * Applies a user's visible Today-plan status change to the current item list.
 *
 * This helper keeps status transitions local to the Today flow; persistence and
 * analytics stay with the caller so the UI can decide when the change becomes durable.
 */
export function updateTodayPlanItemStatus(
  planItems: AiPlanItem[],
  planItemId: string,
  status: PlanItemStatus,
) {
  // ...
}
```

For complex functions, use one short flow comment before the branch that would otherwise be hard to scan:

```ts
// Keep AI-generated revisions reviewable: they are persisted only after user approval.
if (response.type === "plan_revision_suggestion") {
  await persistPlanRevision(response.revision);
}
```

Review questions:

- Can a new contributor understand the flow from exported TSDoc alone?
- Does the comment explain intent, ownership, or product rule?
- Would the comment still be true after a likely product change?
- Is a complex branch missing a short flow comment?

## Project File Rules

Use this default structure:

```txt
apps/mobile/src/
  app/
  features/
    onboarding/
    plan/
    today/
    adjustment/
    progress/
  shared/
    ui/
    hooks/
    lib/
packages/
  core/
    domain/
    analytics/
  ai/
  db/
```

Adapt the feature names to the actual product domain. Do not copy example domains such as `plan`, `today`, or `adjustment` into unrelated services.

## Naming Rules

Names must describe product intent and responsibility, not implementation mechanics.

Avoid:

- `checkSomething`
- `doAction`
- `saveChain`
- `handleData`
- `processItem`

Prefer:

- `validateBeforeEstimateSubmission`
- `canSubmitEstimateRequest`
- `shouldShowWastePriceModifier`
- `handleEstimateRequestSubmit`

Boolean names and predicates should use:

- `is`: current state.
- `has`: possession or existence.
- `can`: capability or permission.
- `should`: decision or intended execution.

Do not encode raw technical values repeatedly at call sites. Translate them into domain language once and reuse the named rule.

## Public Website Standards

For public company, marketing, local-service, or content websites, the following are release requirements rather than optional polish.

### Responsive Behavior

- Support mobile and desktop from the same content and domain model.
- Define breakpoint behavior for navigation, grids, comparison tables, forms, calculators, galleries, and sticky contact actions.
- Avoid device-specific duplicated pages or duplicated business rules.
- Keep tap targets, form controls, and fixed actions usable on narrow screens.
- Test representative mobile, tablet, laptop, and wide desktop viewports.

### SEO

- Define unique title, description, canonical URL, Open Graph metadata, and indexability for every public route template.
- Centralize metadata generation by page type.
- Do not duplicate thin location pages with only the place name changed.
- Use semantic heading order and meaningful link labels.
- Include crawlable internal links between service, price, portfolio, review, FAQ, and location pages.
- Generate `robots.txt` and XML sitemap from the same route/content source of truth.
- Exclude private, preview, parameter-only, and non-canonical routes from the sitemap.

### Structured Data

- Generate JSON-LD from typed domain data rather than handwritten page fragments.
- Use only schema types supported by real page content, such as `LocalBusiness`, `Organization`, `Service`, `FAQPage`, `BreadcrumbList`, and `Article`.
- Do not publish ratings, prices, locations, licenses, or business claims that are not verified.
- Keep visible page content and structured data consistent.
- Test structured data output and prevent duplicate entities across nested layouts.

### Content Architecture

- Keep service, price, location, FAQ, portfolio, review, contact, and business identity data in explicit domain models.
- Page templates consume domain data; they do not own business facts.
- A change to a phone number, operating area, price rule, CTA destination, or company claim should have one obvious edit location.
- RSS/API normalization belongs at the integration boundary, not inside UI components.

## Final Review Checklist

Before accepting frontend work, verify:

1. Does this value really need state?
2. Can this condition be expressed in domain language?
3. Is business logic absent from JSX?
4. Are repeated conditions and calculations centralized?
5. Does each function, hook, and component have one responsibility?
6. Are business rules encapsulated in one obvious location?
7. Is data flow and state ownership predictable?
8. Can large behavior be composed from smaller independently testable units?
9. Do names explain intent without reading implementation?
10. Would a likely product change require the minimum number of edits?
11. For public websites, are responsive behavior, SEO metadata, sitemap generation, structured data, and internal linking covered?

## Review Checklist

Before a change is accepted:

- Is business logic outside JSX?
- Are domain rules named?
- Are repeated conditions centralized?
- Is derived state avoided?
- Are hooks focused?
- Are components small enough to change safely?
- Do exported functions, hooks, components, and domain types have useful TSDoc?
- Do complex branches include short flow comments where they clarify intent?
- Are analytics events emitted near user actions, not scattered randomly?
- Can a future product change be made in one obvious place?
