# Design System Spec

## Purpose

This file turns design philosophy into repeatable UI decisions.

Do not treat the design system as a large component library on day one. For MVP, define the smallest set of tokens, components, states, and layout rules needed to make the core loop feel intentional.

## Design System Inputs

Before defining UI tokens, read:

- `docs/design-philosophy.md`
- `docs/design-tone-and-manner.md`
- `docs/interaction-principles.md`
- `docs/ui-quality-philosophy.md`
- `docs/visual-composition-rules.md`
- `docs/service-definition.md`
- `docs/g-stack.md`
- `docs/superpowers.md`

## Visual Personality

Define the product's visual personality in one sentence:

```txt
The product should feel [adjective], [adjective], and [adjective], without feeling [anti-trait] or [anti-trait].
```

Examples:

- Calm, precise, and supportive, without feeling medical or childish.
- Operational, dense, and trustworthy, without feeling cold or bureaucratic.
- Expressive, playful, and fast, without feeling chaotic or toy-like.

## Token Requirements

Define tokens before building repeated UI.

Before choosing token values, define what the screen must make visible without relying on explanatory copy:

- Current user state.
- Primary object.
- Primary action.
- Review, progress, risk, or completion state.

If an operational screen needs paragraphs to make these clear, fix the layout and object model before tuning colors, type, or radius. Reading, legal, detail, and content surfaces may legitimately use prose as the primary object.

### Color

Required semantic colors:

- `background`
- `surface`
- `surfaceSubtle`
- `border`
- `textPrimary`
- `textSecondary`
- `textMuted`
- `accentPrimary`
- `accentSecondary`
- `success`
- `warning`
- `danger`
- `focus`

Rules:

- Do not build a one-hue interface unless the brand explicitly requires it.
- Avoid relying only on red/green to communicate state.
- Define contrast expectations for text and interactive controls.
- Use color to clarify state, not to decorate empty space.

### Typography

Required text roles:

- `screenTitle`
- `sectionTitle`
- `body`
- `supporting`
- `caption`
- `dataLabel`
- `buttonLabel`

Rules:

- Match type scale to the container.
- Do not use hero-sized type inside dense tools.
- Do not scale font size with viewport width.
- Keep letter spacing at `0` unless a brand system explicitly defines otherwise.

### Spacing

Start with a small spacing scale:

```txt
4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 40
```

Rules:

- Use spacing to show hierarchy.
- Do not stack cards inside cards.
- Define stable dimensions for repeated controls, tiles, toolbars, and action bars.

### Shape

Rules:

- Use restrained radius by default.
- Cards should usually be `8px` radius or less unless the brand intentionally uses softer shapes.
- Use shape to group related actions, not to make every section float.

## MVP Component Inventory

Define only the components needed for the core loop.

Required for most products:

- App shell or screen frame.
- Primary button.
- Secondary button.
- Icon button, if icons are used.
- Text input.
- Select, segmented control, or radio group for option sets.
- Checkbox or toggle for binary settings.
- Card for repeated items only.
- Empty state.
- Loading state.
- Error state.
- Confirmation or review surface.

For AI products:

- AI response surface.
- Structured suggestion card.
- User approval control.
- Invalid or uncertain AI output state.
- Human-editable correction state.

## State Model

Every important UI component should define:

- Default.
- Hover or press.
- Focus.
- Disabled.
- Loading.
- Error.
- Empty.
- Success or approved, if relevant.

## Layout Rules

- Build the actual product experience as the first screen, not a marketing page.
- Make current state, primary object, and next action visible in the first viewport.
- Use visual hierarchy, state, grouping, progress, and object structure before helper copy.
- Keep operational tools dense but readable.
- Keep consumer apps warm but not decorative.
- Do not use generic chatbot layout if chat is only one input method.
- Do not use a dashboard when the product's core promise is a guided flow.
- Keep primary action visible without drowning the user in actions.
- Avoid title, paragraph, card-stack defaults on operational surfaces unless the product object genuinely requires that format.
- Avoid repeated same-weight text blocks; convert them into structured objects, status rows, or direct manipulation controls.

## Design System Done Criteria

The design system is ready for MVP implementation when:

- Tokens exist for color, type, spacing, and state.
- The core loop can be represented with the component inventory.
- The first viewport passes the three-second visibility test.
- Important UI objects have visible states and clear actions.
- Primary, secondary, and destructive actions are visually distinct.
- AI or automation outputs are reviewable before they mutate user data.
- Mobile and desktop constraints are documented when relevant.
