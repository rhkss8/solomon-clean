# New Service Starter Protocol

## Purpose

For every new service, start from the same operating structure.

The only required custom inputs are:

- Service definition.
- Target persona.
- Core user pain.
- Desired user transformation.

Everything else should be generated from the shared starter protocol.

## Required Inputs

### 1. Service Definition

Answer in one sentence:

This service helps `[persona]` achieve `[outcome]` by `[core mechanism]`.

### 2. Persona

Define:

- Who they are.
- What situation they are in.
- What they already tried.
- Why existing solutions failed.
- What moment makes them search for a new product.

### 3. Core Pain

Use plain language.

Bad:

- "Need better AI personalization."

Good:

- "When [specific situation] happens, the user feels [specific pain]."

### 4. Desired Transformation

Define the before and after.

Before:

- What the user feels or does today.

After:

- What the user can do after the product works.

## G-Stack

G-Stack is the default project operating stack for new services.

### G1. Goal Stack

Defines what the product must prove.

Required outputs:

- One-line MVP goal.
- Core loop.
- Primary success metric.
- Secondary metrics.
- Non-goals.

### G2. Growth Stack

Defines how the first users are acquired and learned from.

Required outputs:

- First 10 users.
- First 50 users.
- Acquisition channel.
- Feedback channel.
- Retention hypothesis.

### G3. Governance Stack

Defines rules that keep development from drifting.

Required outputs:

- Scope guardrails.
- Decision log.
- Definition of done.
- Stop conditions.
- Release gates.

### G4. Ground Truth Stack

Defines what data tells the team whether the product works.

Required outputs:

- Analytics events.
- User state model.
- Experiment dashboard questions.
- QA checklist.
- Manual observation plan.

### G5. Generation Stack

Defines how AI participates in the product.

Required outputs:

- AI functions.
- JSON contracts.
- Prompt fixtures.
- Regression checks.
- Fallback behavior.

### G6. Gestalt Stack

Defines the product's design philosophy and experience system.

Required outputs:

- Design production pipeline.
- Reference brief.
- Design philosophy.
- UX strategy.
- Interaction principles.
- Visual system rules.
- Service design blueprint.
- Design review rubric.
- Design QA checklist.

## Superpowers

Superpowers are the few abilities the service gives the user that existing products do not.

Rules:

- 1 to 3 superpowers only.
- Each superpower must map to a core product flow.
- Each superpower must be testable in the MVP.
- Avoid generic claims like "AI personalized experience."

Template:

```txt
As a [persona], I can [new ability], so that [meaningful outcome].
```

## New Project Kickoff Flow

1. Define service in one sentence.
2. Define primary persona.
3. Define the user's before/after transformation.
4. Write 1 to 3 superpowers.
5. Generate G-Stack.
6. Generate MVP todo.
7. Route the first vertical slice through `docs/work-routing.md`.
8. Create only the design, engineering, AI, analytics, and QA artifacts required by that slice.
9. Record product-visible decisions as they are made.
10. Expand domain contracts when a real implementation or release risk triggers them.

Do not generate the entire documentation catalog before the first slice. The catalog is a capability library, not a mandatory kickoff report chain.

## Lesson-And-Run Memory

Every new service should maintain:

- `docs/decision-log.md`
- `docs/lessons-and-rules.md`
- `docs/deep-thinking-workflow.md`
- `docs/inbox/`
- `docs/wiki/`
- `docs/reentry-protocol.md`
- `docs/starter-acceptance.md`

Promotion path:

1. Chat insight.
2. Project decision or lesson.
3. Harness rule.
4. Checklist item.
5. Reusable starter update.

## Knowledge Wiki

Use `docs/inbox/` for original material and `docs/wiki/` for Codex-generated synthesis.

This wiki is optional and should not be loaded for every task. Use it when product intent, research, UX, copy, positioning, or design evidence matters.

Rules:

- Original material goes in `docs/inbox/`.
- Wiki pages follow `docs/wiki/schema.md`.
- Wiki pages use `[[Wiki Links]]`.
- Humans edit inbox sources, not wiki synthesis.
- Current code, tests, and direct user requests take priority during narrow maintenance.

## Deep Thinking

Use `tars think` before product planning, system design, UX direction, large implementation, or ambiguous todo work.

This is the planning counterpart to `tars maintain`:

- `tars maintain` keeps existing behavior stable while making a small correction.
- `tars think` expands the problem space before execution, compares options, excludes off-scope work, and then shrinks the plan into one small vertical slice.

Do not use `tars think` as a report generator. It should improve the next implementation step, not create extra artifacts.

## Starter Acceptance And Re-Entry

Use `docs/starter-acceptance.md` when changing TARS or copying the starter into a new project.

Use `docs/reentry-protocol.md` when resuming after a context reset, machine switch, or long break.

These files keep the harness deterministic without introducing a heavy report chain.
