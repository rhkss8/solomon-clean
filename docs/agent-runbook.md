# Agent Runbook

## Mission

Build the MVP until the core loop is complete:

`[Core loop from docs/g-stack.md]`

Use `docs/new-service-starter-protocol.md` as the reusable kickoff protocol.

## Start Every Work Cycle

1. Read `docs/agent-runbook.md`.
2. For a new project or an incomplete kickoff, read `docs/project-start-checklist.md` and run its readiness audit before planning or implementation.
3. Read `docs/lessons-quick.md`.
4. Read `docs/mvp-todo.md`.
4. Read `docs/mvp-execution-harness.md`.
5. Read `docs/decision-log.md`.
6. Read `docs/lessons-and-rules.md`.
7. Read `docs/decision-gates.md`.
8. If doing maintenance, bug fixes, corrections, or refactors, read `.codex/skills/tars-maintenance/SKILL.md` and `docs/maintenance-workflow.md`.
9. If doing product planning, system design, UX direction, large implementation, or ambiguous todo work, read `.codex/skills/tars-deep-thinking/SKILL.md` and `docs/deep-thinking-workflow.md`.
10. If resuming after a context reset, break, or another PC, read `docs/reentry-protocol.md` and `docs/workstation-handoff.md`.
11. If changing kickoff structure, read `docs/new-service-starter-protocol.md` and `docs/new-service-copy-pack.md`.
12. If changing product definition, read `docs/service-definition.md`, `docs/g-stack.md`, and `docs/superpowers.md`.
13. If product intent, research, UX, copy, positioning, or design evidence is unclear, read `docs/wiki/schema.md` and `docs/wiki/index.md`.
14. If touching UI, UX, visual design, or copy, first confirm the Visual Direction Gate in `docs/project-start-checklist.md`, then read `docs/design-production-pipeline.md`, `docs/design-reference-brief.md`, `docs/design-philosophy.md`, `docs/interaction-principles.md`, `docs/design-system-spec.md`, `docs/service-design-blueprint.md`, `docs/design-tone-and-manner.md`, `docs/design-review-rubric.md`, and `docs/design-qa-checklist.md`.
15. If touching frontend code, read `docs/frontend-engineering-standards.md`.
16. If touching AI behavior, read `docs/ai-contracts.md`.
17. If touching metrics, read `docs/analytics-events.md`.
18. If testing or preparing release, read `docs/qa-checklist.md` and `docs/design-qa-checklist.md`.

## Work Selection

Pick the first incomplete todo that unlocks the core loop.

Priority order:

1. Foundation.
2. Product contracts.
3. First core action.
4. Main repeated use flow.
5. Persistence and analytics.
6. Real AI integration if applicable.
7. Release readiness.

Do not spend cycles on non-MVP features.

## Implementation Rule

Prefer vertical slices over horizontal infrastructure.

Good:

- Input -> mock result -> review -> persisted result.

Bad:

- Build a large design library before any user flow works.
- Build AI infrastructure before a mock flow exists.
- Build auth before local core loop is proven.

## Maintenance Rule

For existing behavior, use `.codex/skills/tars-maintenance/SKILL.md`.

Maintenance work must:

- Restate the requested outcome.
- Establish current behavior and root cause before editing.
- Keep the fix scoped to the request.
- Preserve unrelated behavior.
- Add a regression check when practical.
- Run `tars verify` before completion.

## Deep Thinking Rule

For planning, design, architecture, large implementation, or ambiguous todo work, use `.codex/skills/tars-deep-thinking/SKILL.md`.

Use `tars think` when the task needs exploration before execution. This mode must:

- Restate the problem and success criteria.
- Follow a short question cascade.
- Map user state, product goal, current behavior, desired behavior, system surface, risk, and verification.
- Compare at least two options.
- Name excluded work so the agent does not drift.
- Stop for user approval when a decision gate is crossed.
- End with the smallest implementation slice.

Do not use deep thinking as a report generator. Use it to choose better work before editing.

## Knowledge Wiki Rule

Use `docs/inbox/` and `docs/wiki/` as an optional Karpathy-style plain Markdown knowledge graph.

- Humans put original source material in `docs/inbox/`.
- Codex updates `docs/wiki/` with `[[Wiki Links]]` using `docs/wiki/schema.md`.
- Do not read wiki for every task.
- Read wiki only when product intent, research, UX, copy, positioning, or design evidence matters.
- For narrow maintenance, current code, tests, and user request come first.
- If wiki conflicts with source material, current code, tests, or user request, ask which source wins.

## Re-Entry Rule

When resuming after a context reset, machine switch, or long break:

- Do not restart from scratch.
- Follow `docs/reentry-protocol.md`.
- Reconstruct state from git status, TARS status, open todo, and current diff.
- Report branch, worktree state, next todo, applicable workflow, and blockers before editing.

Design rule:

- Do not begin a new project by proposing a stack, palette, logo, sitemap, or implementation plan before running `docs/project-start-checklist.md`.
- Prefill the checklist from conversation and project context. Ask only unanswered blocking questions.
- Do not jump from abstract design philosophy directly into code.
- Before major UI work, produce a reference scan, 2 to 3 visual territories, a direction decision, a wireframe plan, and a high-fidelity screen plan.
- Define design philosophy, interaction principles, and the MVP design system before building repeated UI.
- Keep the design system small enough to serve the first vertical slice.
- Run design review and design QA before marking a UI slice complete.

## Quality Rule

Frontend code must follow `docs/frontend-engineering-standards.md`.

Any code that mixes UI, policy, API, navigation, and analytics in one component should be refactored before moving on.

Every exported function, hook, domain helper, AI/API boundary, persistence helper, and flow-coordinating component should include useful TSDoc. Comments should explain ownership, intent, product rule, or flow guarantees, not repeat syntax.

## Stop Conditions

Only stop when:

- A todo requires user credentials or external account setup.
- A product decision is impossible to infer safely.
- A command needs user approval and cannot proceed.
- The next step crosses an approval gate in `docs/decision-gates.md`.
- The MVP definition of done is satisfied.

Use `docs/decision-gates.md` to decide whether to ask the user or continue.

## Status Update Format

At the end of each cycle, report:

- Completed todo.
- Files changed.
- Checks run.
- Next todo.
- Blockers, if any.

## End Every Work Cycle

Before moving to the next todo:

1. Run `tars verify`.
2. Run `tars done`.
3. Commit the completed slice.
4. Then run `tars next`.

The git pre-commit hook should run the same checks. Do not bypass it unless the user explicitly asks.

## Lesson-And-Run Loop

At the end of each meaningful discussion, implementation slice, QA pass, or user feedback review:

1. If a decision was made, update `docs/decision-log.md`.
2. If a reusable lesson emerged, update `docs/lessons-and-rules.md`.
3. If the lesson affects execution, update the relevant harness doc.
4. If the same rule appears in multiple projects or survives one vertical slice, mark it as a reusable starter candidate.

Do not let important project knowledge live only in chat.
